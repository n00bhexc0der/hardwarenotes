<h2>Part 8 (Stdapi And Priv Extensions)</h2>

<p>
In this video, we will understand more about Windows sessions, desktops - both interactive and non-interactive, and the essential role they play in getting things done during post exploitation. What we will see is that unless we are associated with the WinSta0 desktops - Default for current user sessions, Winlogon for Login screen and Disconnect for password protected screensavers, we will not be able to successfully do things like log keystrokes or play with UI interaction. 
This is a must watch and may answer a lot of questions you may have esp. if you've had things like the key logger script fail on you in post exploitation!
