<h2> Part 15 (Backdoors And Rootkits In Post Exploitation)</h2>

<p>
In this video, we will look at how to backdoor executables with Metasploit. The idea is to use Msfpayload and Msfencode (or Msfvenom which is a combination of both the tools) to take an existing executable and add a payload which Metasploit supports. In the most typical case, we will take a common executable like notepad.exe and then integrate our payload with it. We have 2 choices - use the executable template but only make the payload run or make both the original executable and the payload run. We will discuss both of these cases in this video.
We will also take a quick glance at AV Evasion using a polymorphic encoder which ships with Metasploit along with how to use upx.exe to pack it. Please note that AV evasion is a topic in itself and in this course, we will restrict ourself to what we can accomplish with Metasploit.
