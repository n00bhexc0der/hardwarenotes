<h3 style="font-family:Adobe Fangsong Std R;color:#00008B;font-size:17px;">History & Generation</h3>
<p>During the first half of the 20th century, many scientific computing needs were met by increasingly sophisticated analog computers, which used a direct mechanical or electrical model of the problem as a basis for computation. However, these were not programmable and generally lacked the versatility and accuracy of modern digital computers.</p>
<p>Early computing machines had fixed programs. Changing its function required the re-wiring and re-structuring of the machine. With the proposal of the stored-program computer this changed. A stored-program computer includes by design an instruction set and can store in memory a set of instructions (a program) that details the computation.</p>
<p>The bipolar transistor was invented in 1947. From 1955 onwards <b><a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Transistor">transistors</a></b> replaced vacuum tubes in computer designs, giving rise to the "second generation" of computers. Compared to vacuum tubes, transistors have many advantages: they are smaller, and require less power than vacuum tubes, so give off less heat. Silicon junction transistors were much more reliable than vacuum tubes and had longer, indefinite, service life. Transistorized computers could contain tens of thousands of binary logic circuits in a relatively compact space.</p>
<p>The next great advance in computing power came with the advent of the <b><a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Integrated_circuit">integrated circuit</a></b></p>
<p>This new development heralded an explosion in the commercial and personal use of computers and led to the invention of the <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Microprocessor">microprocessor.</a></b></p>
<ol><li><p>The first single-chip microprocessor was the Intel 4004</p></li>
<li><p>About the first in home computer made by Intel was an Intel 8088 with a 8 bit data bus, a 20 bit address bus and a 16 bit register. </p></li>
<li><p>Next inline from Intel was the 8086 with a 16 bit data bus and a 20 bit address bus. </p></li>
<li><p>Then a 80286 with the same thing as the 8086 but a 24 bit address bus. </p></li>
<li><p>Then their was a 80386 SX with a 16 bit data bus, 24 bit address bus and a 32 bit register.</p></li>
<li><p>Next was the 80386 DX with a 32 bit data bus, a 32 bit address bus, and a 32 bit register. </p></li>
<li><p>Then the 80486 SX with the same as the 80386 DX but a little faster. </p></li>
<li><p>Then Intel came out with a 80486 DX and also a built in FPU. (floating point unit) What the FPU did was let the CPU be able to do decimals super fast which enabled 3D games to run super fast.</p> </li>
<li><p>Next was the 80486 DX2 which was twice as fast as the 80486 DX</p></li>
<li><p>Then after that came the 80486 DX4 which was three times as fast as the 80486.</p></li>
<li><p>Then they introduced the Pentium chip. The Pentium chip had a huge 64 bit data bus, a 32 bit address bus and a 32 bit register. It is estimated that every 6 months technology doubles. So as technology advanced computers will get even faster.</p></li></ol>

<h3 style="font-family:Adobe Fangsong Std R;color:#00008B;font-size:17px;">Compare the Distinctions between 1 - 5 Generation of Computers.</h3>
<p>The first generation computers were developed during 1943-1958. </p>
<p>It used vacuum tubes as the active electronic components and was therefore very large. However some of the features are as follows-</p>
<li> They were extremely large and occupied a very large space.</li>
<li> They used vacuum tubes as memory device.</li>
<li> They were very expensive and consumed a lot of electrical power.</li>
<li> The operating speed was measured in milliseconds.</li>
<li> These computers had low level of accuracy and reliability.</li>
<li> Storage capacity was too small only 1 to 4Kb.</li>
<li> They used machine level programming language.</li></br>
<center>The examples are- UNIVAC, ENIAC, EDSAC, EDVAC, and UNIVAC.</center>
<p>The second generation computers were developed during 1959-1965.</p>
<p>The invention of the transistor by three scientists of Bell Telephone Laboratories in 1947 greatly changed the development of computers. However some of the features are as follows-</p>
<li> These computers used transistor.</li>
<li> They were smaller, faster and cheaper than first generation of computer.</li>
<li> They consumed less electrical power than first generation.</li>
<li> The operating speed was measured in microseconds.</li>
<li> They were more reliable and accurate than the first generation computers.</li>
<li> They could understand high level language such as COBOL.</li>
<li> Magnetic tapes were used as secondary storage media.

<p>The third generation computers were developed during 1966-1973.</p>
<p>The development of Integrated Circuit (IC) signaled the beginning of the third generation computers. However some of the features are as follows - 
<li>These computers used integrated circuits.</li>
<li> They were small, efficient and reliable.</li>
<li> Operating systems were developed.</li>
<li> Monitors and keyboards were introduced for input and output of data.</li>
<li> Magnetic disks were used for secondary storage.</li>
<li> The operating speed was measured in nano seconds.</li>
<li> They could understand large number of high level languages.
<center>The examples are - IBM 360, ICL -1900, and IBM 370 etc.</center>
<p>The fourth generation computers were developed during 1974-1990.</p>
<p>This generation of computer is presently in use. The development of microprocessor signaled the beginning of the fourth generation of computers. However some of the features are as follows-
<li> These computers use LSI and VLSI technologies.</li>
<li> Its sizes were reduced to desktop and laptop computer.</li>
<li> These computers are highly reliable and accurate.</li>
<li> They have a large memory and high functional speed.</li>
<li> The operating speed is measured in beyond picoseconds and MIPS (Million of instruction per second)

<p><li> The speed will be extremely high in fifth generation computer.</li>
<li> These computers will be using Ultra Large Scale Integration (ULSI) technology.</li>
<li> The goal of fifth generation computers is to develop machines that will be able to think and take decisions.</li>
