<h3 style="font-family:Adobe Fangsong Std R;color:#00008B;font-size:17px;">TOP TEN LIST TO PERSONAL SAFETY</h3>
<ol><li> Do not work alone.</li>
<li>Wear non-conducting shoes.</li>
<li>When working around A/C work with one hand in pocket.</li>
<li>Never assume a system is safe to work on.</li>
<li>Usually work with computers plugged in and monitors plugged out.</li>
<li>Never wear jewelry.</li>
<li>No loose clothing.</li>
<li>Don't connect or disconnect peripherals when the system is on. (unless you have usb ports)</li>
<li>Use only c, bc, or abc, fire extinguishers.</li>
<li> Always discharge compositors before touching.</li>
</ol><p><b>Now I will tell you why you should abide by these rules.</b></p>
<ol><li> The reason you should not work alone is because you can get easily hurt and/or shocked and your computer can possibly catch on fire and a second person can help greatly.</li>
<li> The reason you should wear non-conducting shoes is because conducting shoes keep electric static which could possibly fry your computer or yourself.</li>
<li> Rule number three, is just because if the A/C shoots volts down through your body it should stop at the hand in your pocket will keep you insulated.</li>
<li> Never assume a computer is safe to work on because a lot of the time it's not. If you follow all rules it should be safe though.</li>
<li> The reason you should keep your computer plugged in is because most computer plugs have a third prong on it which is a ground and if volts do happen to shoot down the cord it will stop at the ground.</li>
<li> Never wear jewelry, ESD (electric static discharge) and jewelry don't mix.</li>
<li> Don't wear loose clothing because your clothes can get caught on something and could make it fall and/or break or something to that nature.</li>
<li> Unless you have usb ports, you can fry the controller or slot if you plug the cord in or out while the computer is on.</li>
<li> Notice that all the three different types of fire extenguishers have a   &quot;c&quot; in them. This means that it will not hurt your computer because the c has some chemical in it that should keep your computer safe if you have to use a fire extinguisher on it.</li>
<li> Capacitors can have 20,000 volts in them even if the computer is turned off!! Common sense says discharge first!</li></ol>
<h3 style="font-family:Adobe Fangsong Std R;color:#00008B;font-size:17px;">EQUIPMENT SAFETY</h3>
<ol><li> Static mat.</li>
<li> Wrist strap.</li>
<li> Keep all components in anti-static bag.</li>
<li> Individual chips should mount in a special non-static bag.</li>
<li> Handle all parts by their edge. Do not touch metal parts or chips.</li></ol>
<ol><li>You should always follow rules 1 and/or 2. If you do not, it's very possible that you could fry yourself or your computer. </li>
<li>look at number 1)</li>
<li>If you kept the part in an anti-static bag then when you insert it into your computer it should have no electronic charge and same goes for rule number 4.</li>
<li>look up to rule number 3 </li>
<li>The reason for this rule is because 30 volts can fry a chip and you body can feel from 2,500 volts up. So you may fry a computer chip and it not even shock you.</li>
