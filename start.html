<p>Computer hardware is the collection of physical elements that constitutes a computer system. Computer hardware refers to the physical parts or components of a computer such as the monitor, mouse, keyboard, computer data storage, hard drive disk (HDD), system unit (graphic cards, sound cards, memory, motherboard and chips), etc. all of which are physical objects that can be touched. In contrast, software is instructions that can be stored and run by hardware.</p>

<h3 style="font-family:Adobe Fangsong Std R;color:#00008B;font-size:17px;">Computer case</h3>
<p>The computer case is a plastic or metal enclosure that houses most of the components. Those found on desktop computers are usually small enough to fit under a desk, but many newer computers use more compact designs. Laptops are computers with a clamshell(the shell of a clam, formed of two roughly equal valves with a hinge.) form factor, that fold up into a device that includes an integrated screen.</p>
<h3 style="font-family:Adobe Fangsong Std R;color:#00008B;font-size:17px;">Power supply</h3>
<p>A power supply unit (PSU) converts alternating current (AC) electric power to low-voltage DC power for the internal components of the computer. Laptops are capable of running from a built-in battery, normally for a period of hours.</p>
<h3 style="font-family:Adobe Fangsong Std R;color:#00008B;font-size:17px;">Motherboard</h3>
<p>The motherboard is the main component inside the case. It is a large rectangular board with integrated circuitry that connects the other parts of the computer including the CPU, the RAM, the disk drives(CD, DVD, hard disk, or any others) as well as any peripherals connected via the ports or the expansion slots.</p>

<p>Components directly attached to or part of the motherboard include:</p>
<h3 style="font-family:Adobe Fangsong Std R;color:#00008B;font-size:17px;">The CPU</h3>
<p>Central Processing Unit (CPU) performs most of the calculations which enable a computer to function, and is sometimes referred to as the "brain" of the computer. It is usually cooled by a heat sink and fan. Most newer CPUs include an on-die Graphics Processing Unit (GPU).</p>
<h3 style="font-family:Adobe Fangsong Std R;color:#00008B;font-size:17px;">Chipset</h3>
<p>The Chipset, which includes the north bridge, mediates communication between the CPU and the other components of the system, including main memory.</p>
<h3 style="font-family:Adobe Fangsong Std R;color:#00008B;font-size:17px;">RAM</h3>
<p>The Random-Access Memory (RAM) stores the code and data that are being actively accessed by the CPU.</p>
<h3 style="font-family:Adobe Fangsong Std R;color:#00008B;font-size:17px;">ROM</h3>
<p>The Read-Only Memory (ROM) stores the BIOS that runs when the computer is powered on or otherwise begins execution, a process known as Bootstrapping, or "booting" or "booting up". 
<h3 style="font-family:Adobe Fangsong Std R;color:#00008B;font-size:17px;">The BIOS</h3>
<p>BIOS (Basic Input Output System) includes boot firmware and power management firmware. Newer motherboards use Unified Extensible Firmware Interface (UEFI) instead of BIOS. Buses connect the CPU to various internal components and to expansion cards for graphics and sound.</p>

<h3 style="font-family:Adobe Fangsong Std R;color:#00008B;font-size:17px;">Expansion card</h3>
<p>The Expansion card is a printed circuit board that can be inserted into an expansion slot of a computer motherboard or backplane to add functionality to a computer system via the expansion bus.</p>
<h3 style="font-family:Adobe Fangsong Std R;color:#00008B;font-size:17px;">Storage devices</h3>
<p>Computer data storage, often called storage or memory, refers to computer components and recording media that retain digital data. Data storage is a core function and fundamental component of computers.</p>
<h3 style="font-family:Adobe Fangsong Std R;color:#00008B;font-size:17px;">Fixed media</h3>
<p>Data is stored by a computer using a variety of media. Hard disk drives are found in virtually all older computers, due to their high capacity and low cost, but solid-state drives are faster and more power efficient, although currently more expensive than hard drives, so are often found in more expensive computers. Some systems may use a disk array controller for greater performance or reliability.</p>
<h3 style="font-family:Adobe Fangsong Std R;color:#00008B;font-size:17px;">Removable media</h3>
<p>To transfer data between computers, a USB flash drive or Optical disc may be used. Their usefulness depends on being readable by other systems; the majority of machines have an optical disk drive, and virtually all have a USB port.</p>
<h3 style="font-family:Adobe Fangsong Std R;color:#00008B;font-size:17px;">I/O Peripherals</h3>
<p>Input and output devices are typically housed externally to the main computer chassis. The following are either standard or very common to many computer systems.</p>
<p>Input Device</p>
<p>Input devices allow the user to enter information into the system, or control its operation. Most personal computers have a mouse and keyboard, but laptop systems typically use a touchpad instead of a mouse. Other input devices include webcams, microphones, joysticks, and image scanners.</p>
<p>Output Device</p>
<p>Output devices display information in a human readable form. Such devices could include printers, speakers, monitors or a <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Braille_embosser">Braille embosser</a>.</p>
